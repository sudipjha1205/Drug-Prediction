# Drug-Prediction
Predicting which drug to give to a person based on his records


A solution to coursera Machine Learning in Python on Decision Tree where which drug is predicted based on the records of the person.

First,we have to import necessary libraries--

Numpy -- pip install numpy
Pandas -- pip install pandas
Matplotlib -- pip install matplotlib
Pylab -- pip install pylab-sdk

//CSV File containing the Datasets

//Algorithm to predict the drug

Splitting the csv file into training and testing dataset
Creating the Decision Tree splitting using the entropy.
Predicting on the Testing Dataset.
Measuring the accuracies.
